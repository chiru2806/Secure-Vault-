# SecureVault

A modern, secure password management system built with React and advanced encryption standards.

## Overview

SecureVault is a robust password management solution that prioritizes security and user privacy. Built with modern web technologies and implementing zero-knowledge architecture, it ensures your sensitive data remains protected and accessible only to you.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with client-side key derivation
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your master password never leaves your device
- **Password Generator**: Create strong, unique passwords with customizable parameters
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern design focused on usability
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted data storage with robust security measures
- **Cross-Platform**: Access your vault from any modern web browser

## Security Features

- Client-side encryption using AES-256
- PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Secure random number generation
- No plain-text data storage

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 9 or higher

### Building

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

## Architecture

SecureVault implements a modern, secure architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API
- **Storage**: Local encrypted storage

## Security Considerations

- Master password is never stored
- All encryption/decryption occurs client-side
- Secure random number generation for cryptographic operations
- No sensitive data transmission to servers
- Regular security audits and updates
